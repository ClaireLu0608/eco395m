Hello, everyone! I'm Yu Lu, and I'm currently in my first year of the master's program in Operations Research and Industrial Engineering. I completed my undergraduate studies in Data Science, and I'm particularly interested in machine learning models and their applications. Through this course, I hope to gain more advanced techniques that will help me better organize and analyze data.

In my free time, I enjoy photography, staying fit, hiking, and visiting museums. It's a pleasure to meet you all!
